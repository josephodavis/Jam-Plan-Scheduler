    students <- list of students
    classesF <- list of full classes
    classesH <- list of half classes
    allClasses <- list of all classes
    csv <- csv path
    fullClasses <- number of full classes, assuming a certain format of csv file where full classes come first

    constructor Schedule(String path, int numFullClasses) creates a blank schedule

    function prepare() adds all of the classes in their proper places and initializes all of the students with their preferences
        numCols <- count columns of csv

        go through each column and initialize people's priorities, create all of the proper lists and objects

    function readCol(int col, String delimiter) takes the data from a column in a csv file and returns it in the form of a string array

    function countCols(String delimiter) returns the number of columns in a csv file
